    <h3>A REAL ALE BREWERY IN CHICAGO, IL</h3> <br>
    We are two young men with a common vision and an inexorable passion for
    beer, motivated to give Chicago real English ale.  Beer is what we offer
    and the absolute best beer is what we deliver.  Present Tense wants to be
    known for nothing other than remarkable, traditional English ale.  We are
     devoted to producing beer that stands on its own – no need for gimmicky
     marketing, ridiculous beer names, experimental flavors, and eye-catching
      branding.  No one will question our beer or make excuses for our beer.
       When you buy our beer, you know exactly what you are getting…real English
        ale - consistent, honest, straightforward, and genuine.
    On the surface, making exceptional beer and enjoying it with good company
     is the inspiration behind Present Tense , but running through our veins
     and seeping out into every beer we make is the insatiable conviction to live
     in the present and to delight in the moment in which we find ourselves.
     To lose sight of this is the perpetual obstacle to an abundant life.
     Our goal is for Present Tense to  be a frequent reminder of the things in
     life that transcend the regrets of the past, the anxiety of the future, the
      delusion of progress and self-reliance, and the self-gratifying expectations
       of the now.  Freedom from such things is what is meant by living in the
       Present Tense.

          <div class="beer-description">
            <h3>First Gold IPA</h3><br>
          <h5>ABV: 5.8%<br>
          FG: 1.015<br>
          IBU’s: 51</h5><br>
          <p>For all the bandwagon hop heads and fickle, uninformed craft beer
            dabblers...this beer is not about following the crowd or joining
            the masses of taste bud destroying, one and done beers…this is a
            different type of IPA; the unassuming, yet assertive type; the type
            that need not outdo another because this beer simply is what it is –
            upfront hoppy, floral character complimenting a grainy, classic
            English malt profile</p>
          </div>

              <h5>ABV: 2.9% <br>
              FG: 1.011 <br>
              IBU’s: 20</h5><br>

           <p>A subtle, yet complex flavor profile. Up front rich maltiness
             dominates, but to the more distinguishing palette a slight grassy
             note from the Goldings hops emerges before the dry, crisp finish.
             A very easy to drink “session” beer enjoyed for centuries by the
             hard working English middle class.</p>

          <h3>Ordinary Bitter</h3><br>
           <h5>ABV: 4.3%<br> 
            FG: 1.013<br>
           IBU’s: 36</h5><br>
           <p>The bready, biscuity malt flavor establishes a distinct English
            character to balance a fruity and floral hop assertiveness. Medium
            bodied with a satisfying bitter finish.</p>

         FG: 1.018<br>
         IBU’s: 36</h5><br>
          <p>This beer does not fit in a box; it transcends any label that you
          would put on it.  Not quite a porter, not quite a brown ale.  The
          deep, roasty character of a porter finds its way into a deep amber
           ale with subtle dried fruit qualities and an easy to drink finish.</p>

          FG: 1.017<br>
          IBU’s: 40</h5><br>
         <p>Bright and complex.  Slightly nutty, toasty, and honey sweet accentuated with subtle yet complex fruity esters. Graham cracker malt profile allows a traditional hop character to flourish.</p>

         IBU’s: 24</h5><br>
         <p>Thick and creamy with pure, unadulterated coffee flavor.  Black as
            night, but no bitterness comes through with a smooth as silk finish.
            Concentrated, cold brewed coffee, with its natural fruitiness and
            caramel flavor, added to compliment this dark and filling stout.</p>
